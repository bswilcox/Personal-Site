    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>This is a project I created for my econometrics class. I created it by pulling data from the IMF and creating a linear regression model that tested the correlation betweeen governmental health care expenditure and labor productivity. The model found that their was a positive correlation between the two and suggest that it is a wise investment for governments to guarantee the continued health of their citizens.</p>
